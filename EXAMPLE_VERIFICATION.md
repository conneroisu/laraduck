```

### Features Demonstrated

1. **Analytical Models**
   - Customer: RFM analysis, CLV calculation, churn prediction
   - Order: Revenue analytics, cohort analysis
   - OrderItem: Market basket analysis, product affinity
   - Product: Performance metrics, velocity, ABC analysis

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Executive dashboards with KPIs
   - Time-series analysis with various granularities
   - Customer segmentation (RFM)
   - Product performance analytics
   - Sales forecasting
   - Retention cohort analysis

3. **File Operations**
   - Export to Parquet, CSV, JSON
   - Partitioned exports by date/region
   - Direct file querying capabilities
   - Import from multiple formats

4. **DuckDB-Specific Features**
   - Window functions with QUALIFY
   - CTEs (recursive and non-recursive)
   - GROUP BY ALL
   - Sampling (TABLESAMPLE)
   - Batch operations optimized for OLAP

### Verification Results

- ✅ All model files load correctly
- ✅ Analytics classes are syntactically valid
- ✅ Executable scripts have no syntax errors
- ✅ Database operations work (tested with SQLite)
- ✅ Demo runs successfully with sample data

### Running the Example

1. **With DuckDB** (requires saturio/duckdb package):
   ```bash
   cd examples/ecommerce-analytics
   composer install
   php setup.php
   php analytics.php
   ```

2. **Demo with SQLite** (works out of the box):
   ```bash
   php examples/ecommerce-analytics/demo-sqlite.php
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   php examples/ecommerce-analytics/verify-example.php
   ```

### Key Takeaways

The example successfully demonstrates:

1. **Architecture**: How to structure a Laravel application for analytical workloads
2. **Patterns**: Best practices for OLAP queries in an ORM context
3. **Features**: Utilizing DuckDB's unique capabilities through Laravel
4. **Performance**: Batch operations and columnar optimizations
5. **Flexibility**: File querying without ETL pipelines

## Note on Dependencies

The full implementation requires the DuckDB PHP extension (`saturio/duckdb`). For testing purposes, a mock implementation is included, and the demo uses SQLite to show the concepts in action.

To use with actual DuckDB:
1. Install the DuckDB PHP extension
2. Update composer.json to include the real package
3. Run the examples with full DuckDB functionality
