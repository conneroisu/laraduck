# Laraduck Analytics Dashboard - Livewire Example

A comprehensive Laravel Livewire analytics dashboard showcasing the power of **Laraduck** (DuckDB for Laravel) for high-performance analytical queries and real-time data visualization.

## ü¶Ü What is Laraduck?

Laraduck is a DuckDB driver for Laravel's Eloquent ORM that brings blazing-fast analytical queries to Laravel applications. It enables querying Parquet, CSV, and JSON files directly without importing, while maintaining full Laravel/Eloquent compatibility.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Models

- **`Sale`**: AnalyticalModel with advanced query scopes for sales analytics
- **`Product`**: Product catalog with pricing and category information
- **`Customer`**: Customer data with regional and type classifications

### Livewire Components

- **`SalesOverview`**: Main dashboard metrics and overview charts
- **`AnalyticsChart`**: Interactive charts with multiple data views
- **`ProductAnalytics`**: Detailed product performance analysis

### Key Features

#### Advanced DuckDB Queries
```php
// Daily sales with aggregations
Sale::dailySales()->get();

// Regional performance analysis
Sale::regionSales()->get();

// Moving averages with window functions
Sale::salesTrends(7)->get();

// Top products by revenue
Sale::topProducts(10)->get();
```

#### Real-time Updates
```php
// Livewire component with live data binding
public function loadOverviewData()
{
    $this->totalRevenue = Sale::sum('total_amount');
    // ... other metrics
}
```

#### File Querying (Trait Available)
```php
// Query Parquet files directly (when files are available)
Sale::fromParquetFile('sales/*.parquet')
    ->where('region', 'North America')
    ->sum('revenue');
```

## üîß Configuration

### Database Configuration

The DuckDB connection is configured in `config/database.php`:

```php
'analytics' => [
    'driver' => 'duckdb',
    'database' => database_path('analytics.duckdb'),
    'read_only' => false,
    'memory_limit' => '4GB',
    'max_memory' => '8GB',
    'threads' => 4,
],
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize DuckDB settings via `.env`:

```env
DUCKDB_DATABASE=database/analytics.duckdb
DUCKDB_READ_ONLY=false
DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT=4GB
DUCKDB_MAX_MEMORY=8GB
DUCKDB_THREADS=4
```

## üìà Sample Data

The example includes:
- **10 products** across Electronics and Accessories categories
- **50 customers** distributed across 4 regions
- **500 sales transactions** spanning 90 days
- Realistic pricing, discounts, and transaction patterns

## üéØ Performance Benefits

DuckDB provides significant performance advantages for analytical workloads:

- **Columnar Storage**: Optimized for analytical queries
- **Vectorized Execution**: Fast processing of large datasets
- **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in support for window functions and complex aggregations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Intelligent memory management for large datasets

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Quality

Run these commands to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Check code style with Laravel Pint
composer run lint

# Fix code style issues automatically
composer run lint:fix

# Run tests
composer run test
```

### Adding New Analytics

1. **Create a new scope in the Sale model:**
   ```php
   public function scopeCustomAnalytics($query)
   {
       return $query->select([
           // Your custom analytics
       ]);
   }
   ```

2. **Create a new Livewire component:**
   ```bash
   php artisan make:livewire CustomAnalytics
   ```

3. **Add to the dashboard:**
   ```blade
   <livewire:custom-analytics />
   ```

### File-Based Analytics

To add file querying capabilities:

1. **Add sample data files** (Parquet, CSV, JSON) to a `data/` directory
2. **Use the QueriesFiles trait** in your models
3. **Query files directly:**
   ```php
   Sale::fromParquetFile('data/sales.parquet')
       ->where('amount', '>', 100)
       ->get();
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DuckDB not found:**
   - Install DuckDB: `brew install duckdb` (macOS) or visit [duckdb.org](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/)

2. **Memory issues with large datasets:**
   - Increase `DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT` in your `.env` file
   - Use streaming queries for very large files

3. **Performance optimization:**
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Use DuckDB's `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to optimize queries

### Verification

Run the verification script to check your setup:
```bash
php verify-setup.php
```
